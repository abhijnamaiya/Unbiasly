# Unbiasly
AI-based chrome extension to detect social, economic and racial bias in a sentence/article or a website. Provide alternative neutral sentences based on open source free LLM models.

Built with: 
Open Source LLM model (Gemini 1.5), Python, Javascipt, HTML/CSS, Flair, ML (TARS Classifier).

Procedure to Run&Test:
1. Clone the repository onto your local setup.
2. Make sure all the dependencies are installed. You can refer https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_10_TRAINING_ZERO_SHOT_MODEL.md for installing dependencies.
3. Load up the chrome extension on your browser.
4. Highlight over any sentence and click on the extension to view a neutral bias-free sentence.

What's next:
We plan to expand Unbiasly's capabilities by incorporating more sophisticated language models and expanding its coverage to a wider range of biases. We also aim to integrate the extension with popular productivity tools and social media platforms to maximize its impact.
